* title: Write Unit Tests
* topics: pse
##### !question

1. Use the comments provided to write at least two example input/outputs:
    * Consider at least one nominal and one edge case.
    * What is the expected output for the given input?
    * You can use the examples provided in the prompt, or other examples.
2. Write unit tests for `pascals_triangle` for the nominal and edge cases you identified in the first step.

* title: Create Logical Steps
* topics: pse
##### !question

Without writing code, describe how you would implement `pascals_triangle` in enough detail that someone else could write the code. 
* It may be helpful to break up the problem/algorithm into smaller subproblems/algorithms. For example, 1. Handle invalid input, 2. Given valid input, perform the computation/solve the problem/etc.
* Your logical steps could take the form of a numbered list, pseudo code, or anywhere in between. What's important at this stage is to think through and outline the implementation before writing code.
