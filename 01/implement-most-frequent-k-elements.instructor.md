# Instructor: Implement Most Frequent K Elements

An example of a working implementation:

```python
# Time Complexity: O(N log(N)) where N is the size of the array
# Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the size of the array
def most_frequentk_k_elements(arr, k):
    if len(arr) == 1: return [arr[0]]
    
    frequency_map = {}
    uniques = []

    for num in arr:
        if num in frequency_map:
            frequency_map[num] += 1
            
        else:
            frequency_map[num] = 1
            uniques.append(num)
            
    result = sorted(uniques, key=lambda num: frequency_map[num], reverse=True)

    return result[:k]

# ----- Alternative O(N) solution (provided by Ansel) -----

# assuming we avoid the degenerate pivot case, this will tend towards O(n). the
# following argument assumes we get "good" pivot selection. In this case, the
# maximum number of outer iterations will be log n. during each iteration, we
# halve the number of elements being inspected. The first iteration, we inspect
# all n items. the next, n/2, then n/4, n/8, n/16, etc. The sum of the series of
# halves of n is n, plus the n of the first iteration is 2n, which is O(n).
def select_in_place(el_cnt_arr, k):
    start = 0
    end = len(el_cnt_arr)

        # of the pivot value

            # need more larger items to reach k, and they are to the right of the
